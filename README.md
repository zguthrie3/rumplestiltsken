Esolang coding project for LMC 2700 Class

This program requires a Perl interpreter in order to function correctly. The Perl interpreter recommended is located at the following link: http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
There is a Chef to Perl interpreter within this GitHub repository.
If you are using Mac/Unix, note that you will have to specify a full path to the source file. If the file is in the same directory as the chef.pl file, do "./chef.pl ./mychefprogram.chef". If the file is in the examples folder, do "./chef.pl ./examples/mychefprogram.chef". The complete command line entry might look like this: “perl script/chef examples/hello.chef”

If you are using Windows, note that you will have to run perl on the interpreter. If the file is in the same directory as the chef.pl file, do "perl chef.pl ./mychefprogram.chef". If the file is in the examples folder, do "perl chef.pl examples/mychefprogram.chef".
