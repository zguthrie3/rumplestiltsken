# rumplestiltsken
Esolang coding project for LMC 2700 Class

This program requires a Perl interpreter in order to function correctly. The Perl interpreter recommended is located at the following link: http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
There is a Chef to Perl interpreter within this GitHub repository.

To run your compiled chef programs, you need to use the perl chef interpreter, e.g. "chef.pl rumplestiltsken.chef" or "perl chef.pl rumplestiltsken.chef."

If you are using Mac/Unix, note that you will have to specify a full path to the source file. If the file is in the same directory as the chef.pl file, do "./chef.pl ./rumplestiltsken.chef". If the file is in the examples folder, do "./chef.pl ./examples/rumplestiltsken.chef".

If you are using Windows, note that you will have to run perl on the interpreter. If the file is in the same directory as the chef.pl file, do "perl chef.pl ./rumplestiltsken.chef". If the file is in the examples folder, do "perl chef.pl examples/rumplestiltsken.chef".

A Unicode character table is provided at the following link: http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?utf8=dec

# Please be sure to read the description at the top of the .chef file in order to understand how to type in the various unicode characters
